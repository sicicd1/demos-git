- Things to think about:
	When should you split a repo?
	When should you unite a repo?
	How should you split a repo? (the lines of least interaction).
	How often should one pull or push?
	Should we have a rule about when people pull? (say each morning)
		Is it good to have such a rule?
	When should we push and what reasons are valid for pushing?
		Is going home a good reason?
	Why does a repo become unmanageble when it gets larger?
